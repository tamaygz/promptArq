D I S C L A I M E R

Everything here is AI Generated. UI, Code, Content, ALL OF IT. 
Backstory: For a while I was lookin for a  reason to play with github spark and also parallel for a way to not write my prompts over and over again. 
Existing software either didnt meet my needs or was to expensive, so I created this spark project. Happy to chat about it, there's no "active" development.
Use it, leave it, up to you :-) 

Here's the public spark url / DEMO: https://arqioly-prompt-atom--tamaygz.github.app/

## üéØ What is promptArq?

**promptArq** is a comprehensive prompt management system designed for teams and individuals working with Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a structured, collaborative environment for creating, versioning, improving, and sharing AI prompts across your organization.

Think of it as **Git for AI prompts** - with built-in intelligence to help you write better prompts, track changes over time, and expose them to AI agents through MCP (Model Context Protocol).

3. **Start creating** - Click "New Prompt" to create your first prompt

That's it! No database setup, no API keys, no configuration files.

### First Steps

#### 1. Create a Project
Projects help organize related prompts together.

1. Click **"Projects"** in the header
2. Click **"Create Project"**
3. Give it a name and description
4. Optionally add categories (e.g., "Data Analysis", "Content Writing")

#### 2. Create Your First Prompt
1. Click **"New Prompt"** in the header
2. Fill in the details:
   - **Title**: What this prompt does (or use ‚ú® to auto-generate)
   - **Project**: Select the project you created
   - **Category**: Optional categorization
   - **Tags**: Add relevant tags for filtering
3. Write your prompt in the content area
4. Add variables with `{{variableName}}` syntax if needed
5. Click **"Save"**

#### 3. Improve Your Prompt
1. Open any prompt
2. Click **"Improve Prompt"** button
3. Review the AI-suggested improvements
4. Accept to create a new version, or reject to keep current

#### 4. Execute a Prompt
- **With variables**: Click "Fill Placeholders" ‚Üí Enter values ‚Üí Execute
- **Without variables**: Click "Execute" ‚Üí Select system prompt ‚Üí Run
- Copy the results to clipboard

## üéì Core Concepts

### Projects
Projects are top-level containers that group related prompts. Each project can have:
- Multiple categories
- Custom color schemes
- Team access controls
- Dedicated system prompts

**Example**: "Customer Support", "Content Marketing", "Engineering Workflows"

### Categories
Categories organize prompts within a project. They're project-scoped and help with navigation.

**Example**: Within "Content Marketing" ‚Üí "Blog Posts", "Social Media", "Email Campaigns"

### Tags
Tags provide flexible, cross-project organization. They:
- Work across all projects
- Have custom colors
- Show usage frequency
- Support auto-suggestions

**Example**: "draft", "reviewed", "production", "high-priority"

### Placeholders
Use double-curly-brace syntax to create reusable prompt templates:

```
Write a {{tone}} blog post about {{topic}} for {{audience}}.
The post should be approximately {{word_count}} words.
```

promptArq remembers your placeholder values between uses!

### System Prompts
System prompts define the AI's behavior and personality. They apply with smart precedence:

1. Prompt-level (highest priority)
2. Project-level
3. Category-level
4. Tag-level
5. Team default (lowest priority)

### Version History
Every save creates an immutable version with:
- Full content snapshot
- Timestamp and author
- Optional change notes
- Visual diff from previous version

### Sharing
Two types of sharing:
- **Team sharing**: Invite members to your team for full collaboration
- **Prompt sharing**: Generate a read-only link for individual prompts

## üîå MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration

promptArq implements the Model Context Protocol, allowing AI agents like Claude to access your prompts directly.

### Setup for Claude Desktop

1. Click **"MCP Server"** in promptArq
2. Copy the configuration snippet
3. Open Claude Desktop config file:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   - **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
4. Add the configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "promptArq-prompts": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@modelcontextprotocol/server-fetch",
        "https://your-promptarq-url/api/mcp"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

5. Restart Claude Desktop
6. Your prompts will appear in Claude's context menu

### Enabling Prompts for MCP

1. Open any prompt in promptArq
2. Click the settings/config button
3. Toggle **"Expose to MCP"**
4. Save the prompt

The prompt will now be available to Claude and other MCP clients, organized by project.
